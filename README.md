# Translate with DeepL

[DeepL][1] is a new language translation service based on neural 
network and deep learning algorithms. This extension uses the (unofficial) 
JSON-RPC API to translate texts directly from Visual Studio code.

Currently, German, English, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Polish are 
supported.

## Known Issues

* It's possible to edit the document while waiting for a translation 
  result. It would be best to show a waiting cursor or a modal dialog 
  box, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.
